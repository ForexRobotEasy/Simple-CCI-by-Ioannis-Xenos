# Simple CCI Expert Advisor

This is a simple CCI (Commodity Channel Index) Expert Advisor for the MetaTrader 4 platform. It is designed to identify overbought and oversold conditions in the market and execute trading orders accordingly.

## Parameters

The Expert Advisor has the following user-defined parameters:

- `CCI_Period`: The period for calculating the CCI indicator.
- `Overbought_Level`: The overbought level for the CCI indicator.
- `Oversold_Level`: The oversold level for the CCI indicator.
- `Use_Trend_Continuation`: Whether to use the trend continuation strategy.

## Initialization

The Expert Advisor initializes by creating two buffers: `CCI_Buffer` and `Open_Price_Buffer`. 

The `CCI_Buffer` stores the CCI values for each bar in the history, while the `Open_Price_Buffer` stores the open prices for each bar.

The CCI values and open prices are calculated for the whole history using the `iCCI` and `Open` functions.

## Trading Logic

The Expert Advisor executes trading orders based on the current CCI value.

If the CCI value is below the oversold level (`Oversold_Level`), the Expert Advisor executes a mean reversion strategy by placing a sell order at the market price.

If the CCI value is above the overbought level (`Overbought_Level`), the Expert Advisor executes a trend continuation strategy by placing a buy order at the market price.

## Custom Functions

This code does not include any custom functions or indicators.
